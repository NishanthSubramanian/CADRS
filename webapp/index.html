                  <b>CADRS</b> (Coordinated & Autonomous Drone Rescue System) is a drone rescue system in which drones are
                  deployed in a specified area and the drones find the best possible path to deliver various payloads like
                  first aid kits, food and clothing to locations that are not easily accessible. They may also be used to
                  deliver a large number of items in a short span of time.

                  The objective of our drone system is to enable a central server detect urgency calls from distinct areas. This centralized
                  server controls a system of drones.

                  <ul>
                    <li> There are known emergency points where people are in need of supplies, called nodes that the drones
                      have to deliver.</li>
                    <li>Drones have cameras on them to enable computer vision into these drones.</li>
                    <li>During their operation of delivering to the known nodes, it may come across new nodes (new people
                      that the drone just recognized during its operation and who need the drone to stop and drop off a few
                      supplies).
                    </li>
                    <li>The Rescue operation is a time-critical application where continuous connectivity to ground personnel
                      is mandatory. Thus, persistent network connectivity is desirable to propagate information efﬁciently.
                      Therfore, Wi-Fi cards have been employed in the drone.
                    </li>
                    <li>Since there's no size constraint on our centralized server, we can employ a Wi-Fi card lke IEEE 802.11
                    </li>
                    <li> For example, IEEE 802.11 could be employed as it is easier to transmit contant information in a
                      short period of time</li>
                  </ul>

                    All the known nodes have a quantified attribute called urgency assigned to them (1-100). Number of drones is d and number
                    of nodes is n. Cost to travel from every node to every other is first calculated. Cost of travelling
                    between two nodes depends on two attributes: distance between them and urgency of the destination node.
                    Let the area under consideration be A. The server controls ‘d’ drones .A is divided into d regions, each
                    region assigned to a drone. In each region, the number of nodes may vary. But weight of the minimum spanning
                    tree in every region as small as possible and as close to each other as possible to achieve maximum efficiency
                    in drone movement. This weight of a minimum spanning tree of any region is addition of the cost of traversing
