# CADRS
CADRS (Coordinated & Autonomous Drone Rescue System) is a drone rescue system in which drones are deployed in a specified area and the drones find the best possible path to deliver various payloads like first aid kits, food and clothing to locations that are not easily accessible. They may also be used to deliver a large number of items in a short span of time.
## Aim 
To build a coordinated & autonomous drone rescue system. This project is a part of codefundo++ 2018.
## Features 
1. **Algorithm describing coordinated movement of drone:**
The drone must move in the most efficient manner in order to make appropriate deliveries, covering all delivery sites using the shortest path. The algorithm should also take into consideration the priority of these delivery sites (some deliveries may be more urgent than others).
2. **A ML jupyter notebook to successfully detect and distinguish between humans and all other objects:**
Our drone must be able to recognize humans and ensure that delivery is rightly made at that site only if a person is detected at that site.
## Technologies To Be Used
- Tensorflow
- Microsoft Azure Cloud Services
- Python
